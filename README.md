# Kout Bunq Assignment

A simple 'chat' application using PHP as backend and JQuery as frontend with HTML/CSS.

# Technologies used:

Backend : PHP

Frontend : JQuery (Javascript)

Database : SQLite

# Folder Structure

The structure should be pretty intuitive. On the `config` folder is sitting all the database side (the SQLite database file and the DB connection), in the `webService` folder you find the PHP's server entry point, which handles every HTTP request and, based on the request method, calls the funtion on the `main` folder, and `script` folder contain the JQuery side.
